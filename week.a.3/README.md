What is the console?  'Either a phywical phyical console or a digital equivalent,'

* Each one has a tty

addtl info unrelated: 
* any process running on a computer can be spied on with a peace pipe written in go.
* pty is a pseudo terminal 
* tty makes it easier to spot than an application (after breaking into a system)
