# Terminal 
- Teleprinter, Teletype, Morris code
- An electronic device that you can type (transcribe) data into
- Earliest Terminal is a teleprinter
  * Teleprinter (teletypewriter, teletype, tty - electromechanical device that sends
    and receives data through multiple communication channells
- needed faster ways to put information into computers 
- Altair computer- on and off or 1 and 0s to enter the numbers
- Altair computer was hooked to a teletype using Morris Code
- Terminial Emulator - is used to replace the tty

# Command Line Interface (CLI)
CLI is a REPL 
REPL- Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
CLI-is a text based user interface

# Shell 
* "Simply put, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.
  On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs available for Linux systems. These include: ksh, tcsh and zsh."
* Differnet languages with the computer.  
* Interface between human and the innerpart of the computer 
* Gui can be used as the shell instead of CLI
* CLI and GUI programs are shells that interact with the kernal to communicate with the hardware
* Without a shell system calls would be needed in C
 
 CLI can be used to get into another computer without having a terminal  
 

## TTY and hacking
Back door vulnerabilities should NOT use TTY when hacking
TTY cam be traced, Dont use it
ex: printer that hadn't been closed. 
Make a rootkit that is untraceable do not use TTU



## Practice
* Watch Videos about Terminal or tty teleprint, teletype, morris code, binary,
  on and off switches 
* Watch videos or find some introduction to Ed or Unix Editor
