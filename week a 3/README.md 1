IF you try to initiate a connection with a private virtual machine that has a NAT connection, you can't because you can't see it. a tunnel is needed
changing to a bridge adapter from a NAT adapter instead of the virtual machine being inside of the virtual machine.  the network thinks the virtual
machine is next to the computer or host.  In bridge as far as the network is concerned the virtual machine is next to the host (comuputer)
* when the connection is changed to bridge, the IP address changes for the vm
